BLOCKBUSTER JACK SMITH UPDATE:

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨MAJOR BREAKING: Donald Trump is accused by the Department of Justice of breaking THREE laws relating to their investigation of January 6. 

Yesterday, Donald Trump revealed on social media that he received a target letter and that he was given four days to report to a Grand Jury. 

We now know the DOJ will present facts to a grand jury that Donald Trump violated the following statutes:

1) CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT OFFENSE OR TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES. 

2) DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW. 

3) TAMPERING WITH A WITNESS, VICTIM, OR INFORMANT. 

The statutes listed likely refer to the prosecutorâ€™s interest in charging Trump with obstructing the election certification process, including Trumpâ€™s efforts to pressure Mike Pence to stop the certification of President Bidenâ€™s 2020 victory.

According to a source in his own team, Trump is expected to be charged with crimes including conspiracy, obstruction, and civil rights violations. 

Jack Smith is NOT messing around. 

A violation of the first statute alone could carry a prison term of 5 years in prison. 

Thereâ€™s no denying it. Jack Smith has the goods.
