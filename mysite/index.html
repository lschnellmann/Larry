        <p>HELLO WORLD! ok, so this where I am editing this file that I hope to run on a website and I notice it does not automatically word wrap and I wonder if that has something to do with that CRLF thing I keep getting warned about that has something to do with how windows does a carriage return at the end of a line or not do a carriage return at the end of a  line, but back to all i want to do is push this file to a stage and commit my ever loving sould to it so I can see it on
            a github pages website that I bought for 12 dollars.!</p>
