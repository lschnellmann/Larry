Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the "mysite" directory.
Customize the site by modifying the files in the "_layouts", "_includes", and "_posts" directories.
For your "Hello World" page, create a new file in the root directory called "index.html" and add your HTML code there.

Install Jekyll plugins (if needed):

Jekyll has a variety of plugins available to extend its functionality.
Open the "Gemfile" in your Jekyll site's root directory and add the plugins you want to use.
For example, if you want to add a plugin called "jekyll-sitemap", add the following line to the "Gemfile": `gem 'jekyll-sitemap'`.
Save the file and run `bundle install` in the terminal to install the new plugins.

Build and preview your site:

In the terminal, navigate to your Jekyll site's root directory.
Run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site locally.
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:4000 to preview your site.

Publish your site:

Once you're satisfied with your site, it's time to publish it.
In your Jekyll site's root directory, run the command `bundle exec jekyll build`.
This will generate your static site files in the "_site" directory.
Upload the contents of the "_site" directory to your web server or hosting provider.
Make sure to configure your web server to serve the files as a website.

As you mentioned, it may take some time (up to 24 hours) for the DNS changes to propagate, so you may need to wait before your domain is accessible.
