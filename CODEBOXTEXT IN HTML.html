    <a href="https://ln.keymate.ai/Frhf52">Unjust Enrichment in Texas | Texas Tax Regulations | Freeman Law</a>: This article discusses the doctrine of unjust enrichment and how it may apply in situations where parties transact without a formal written contract. The doctrine is based on the theory that one party should not benefit at the other's expense. In Texas, it may also be possible to invoke unjust enrichment where a contract exists, but the contract is unenforceable or void. Unjust enrichment is a remedy, not a cause of action or basis for a lawsuit by itself. To be successful in an unjust enrichment claim, the plaintiff must prove the following three elements:
    <ul>
      <li>A party is unjustly enriched</li>
      <li>The receipt of the benefit by one party came at another party's detriment</li>
      <li>There is no contract between the parties either due to unenforceability, impossibility, mistake, voidness, or absence of a formal agreement.</li>
    </ul>
