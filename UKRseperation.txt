The text is a comment on the current web page context, which is a tweet criticizing the Ukrainian government. The text expresses a pro-Russian perspective on the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the role of NATO. The text contains some factual errors and misleading claims, which I will try to explain below.

- The text implies that Ukraine's separation from the Soviet Union in 1991 was conditional on its independence, but this is not true. Ukraine declared its independence unilaterally after a referendum in which more than 90% of the voters supported it.  Ukraine's sovereignty was recognized by most countries in the world, including Russia, which established diplomatic relations with Ukraine in 1992. 
- The text refers to the Minsk accord, which is a series of agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia, the OSCE, and the leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The agreements aimed to end the war in eastern Ukraine, which started when Russia-backed separatists seized parts of the region following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The agreements included a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, release of prisoners, constitutional reform, and restoration of border control. 
- The text claims that NATO pushed Ukraine to break the agreement, but this is not supported by evidence. NATO has supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has condemned Russia's aggression and violations of international law. NATO has also provided political and practical assistance to Ukraine, such as training, equipment, and reforms. However, NATO has not intervened militarily in the conflict, nor has it pressured Ukraine to do so.  
- The text suggests that the deal is off on independence, implying that Russia has a right to intervene or annex parts of Ukraine. This is a false and dangerous assertion that contradicts international law and norms. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state that has the right to choose its own foreign policy and security arrangements. Russia has no legal or moral basis to interfere with Ukraine's internal affairs or territorial integrity.
